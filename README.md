# Well Influence Analysis

### This simulation study is intended as a proof of concept for well influence analysis (WIA), a computationally efficient method for ranking the wells of groundwater monitoring networks by their influence on contaminant concentration estimates in regression-like statistical models.

WIA is used to order the list of monitoring wells in the 'well redundancy analysis' feature of GWSDAT (https://github.com/WayneGitShell/GWSDAT).
